"""`decoy run` -- execute a masking or synthetic-generation pipeline.

CLI.1 commit 3 (2026-06-01): rewired against the V2 engine spine.
Non-chunked runs (the default) go through `run_pipeline`, the engine's
unified entry point that profiles, compiles, and executes mask + generate
tables in one call, using the engine's internal `PandasExecutionAdapter`.
`--chunked` is a separate streaming path (`run_mask_pipeline_chunked`),
mask-only, which still supports substrate selection via
`select_execution_adapter`. `graph` and `convert` are V1-only and have
no engine; the choke-point validator rejects them with a typed error
before this module sees them.

Examples:

  decoy run pipeline.yaml
    Run with default mode (mask).

  decoy run pipeline.yaml --json
    Suppress chrome and emit a structured result for scripting.

  decoy run pipeline.yaml --chunked --chunk-size 100000
    Stream a large source through the engine instead of loading it whole.
    (See: decoy explain chunked.)

  decoy run pipeline.yaml --vault vault.bin
    Write an encrypted token vault for columns marked `vault: true`, so
    they can be recovered later with `decoy unmask`. (See: decoy explain vault.)

  decoy run pipeline.yaml --chunked --substrate polars
    Stream with polars instead of the chunked-path pandas default.
    (--substrate only affects --chunked runs; plain runs always use pandas.
    See: decoy explain substrate.)

  decoy run pipeline.yaml --notify webhook:https://hooks.example.com/x
    Notify a webhook after the run reaches its terminal state. Repeatable;
    kind in webhook/slack/email. Best-effort: a channel failure never
    changes the run's exit code. Webhook signing key from
    DECOY_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET; SMTP from DECOY_NOTIFY_SMTP_HOST/_PORT/
    _USER/_PASS/_FROM. Nothing is persisted to .decoy/workspace.json.

  decoy run pipeline.yaml --notify slack:https://hooks.slack.com/services/x --notify-on failure
    Only notify on a failed run.
